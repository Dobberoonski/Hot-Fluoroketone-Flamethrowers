stuff i would like to do:
    - make and differentiate between new ketone-boiler types, e.g. burner, electric, etc.
    - refactor code (lol like i'd ever do that)
    - incorporate flamethrower wagons and tweaks from other mods
    - moar lang cfgs
    - change ketone-boiler recipe?
    - Better item/recipe icons (I LOVE MY GREEN TINT PROGRAMMER ART)
